            Hi, I was wondering which hobby of mine I should dedicate this project to, that could actually <b> be useful for you.</b> I decided not to bore you with facts about things I like, or videos of me doing them etc., I just gathered some of my favourite recipes hoping you would find at least one of them yummy looking, and either <i>prepare it yourself or give it to someone else to try it!</i> &#129304;
        </p>
        <h2> About me &#128022;</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Kata Csizmadia, I have a masterâ€™s degree in dietetics, but was working as a business assistant in the financial area. I enjoyed helping others for some time, but now I am very much ready to learn a lot about computer science and launch a more fulfilling career. I am so grateful to you and to all the people who have dedicated their time and energy to create this great opportunity for us to learn for free! &#129299;
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time I like doing sports such as aerial hoops, bouldering, via ferrata or hiking. I enjoy creating things, that is why I have started sewing, and tried many techniques to create gifts for my loved ones. I love cooking too, especially foods, that are really different from the ones I have tried, for this reason I have been making dishes from other cultures, and it is very satisfying for me!  &#129325; I usually try new recipes by watching several videos / articles about it and try a mixture of what I've seen in them.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            So thanks for being here and good appetite! &#129316;
